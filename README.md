# Splines
Codes for a project about splines.  
There are five algorithms for the construction of the splines who are divided in linear, quadratic and cubic.  
For the same five types of spline there are algorithms for the obtention of the coeficients of the polynomial equations.  
As for the errors of the splines, there are codes for the error of each type.
In the application area, there is an script for resize of images using cubic splines.
